    The interaction between activities in android is a really powerful composition mechanism. When developing the <a href="../networkbrowser">network browser</a> I dreamed of small adapters for all kind of protocols. Unfortunately a lot of applications are not yet developed in a fashion that makes them usable from other application. I think the mindset of the developers must first switch to a real android way. But when this shift has come the development will be a lot more fun.

    E.g. there are a lot of feature complete ftp-clients in the android market. But when I had to write to the developers and only one developer has implemented my feature request to use them from the networkbrowser ftp-adapter.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this reason I implemented the inspector which should give as much insight into the activities and intent-filters of those activities of the installed application on the device.
