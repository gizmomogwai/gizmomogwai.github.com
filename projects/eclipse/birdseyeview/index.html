          When switching from intellij to eclipse i missed a plugin which showed your source from a birds eye view. E.g. each letter represented as a pixel. I really liked this plugin, because you can estimate the complexitiy of a piece of code by looking at its &quot;graphical&quot; representation. Sure .. something like lines of code or how big one method is is also a good indicator, but i like this graphical approach.

          Its been a while since i made the last change on this plugin. But i still remember, that was kind of difficult to get to the textural representation of the editors (i think this is a good thing, because eclipse also alows you to make graphical editors and so on).

          Another thing was, I did not find a way to get all text-annotations of the system, so the preferences stored simply a set of annotations with optional colors. Each annotation has a name which is shown, so the plugin can work together with annotation that are not known at the time of the build of the plugin.

        The sources are located in my private svn repository, which i access with git.
